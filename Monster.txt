MonsterDesc: Robes clean, eyes dull, the sorcerer gives you a cursory glance and no more. Turning back to his work, he says quietly, “You must be strong to have bested Fredrick.” Satisfied with his work, he turns back to you. With a bored expression, he continues, “However… you will find that strength is a relative term.”

MonsterDesc: A homely little goblin… or is it an orc? A demon? A silvery metal pipe in hand, and well armored. It sees you and jingles a bag of gems before directing your attention to its wares. His intentions may be ill, they do not seem to lethal at least. Money is everyone’s friends in times like these.

MonsterDesc: (With light item) These shadows do not dance to the flicker of your flame. A black mass emerges from the ground with what look like…. Claws? (Without light item) The eerie moans you hear are not those of any creature living or dead. Even in darkness you can feel somethings presence. Perhaps, you think, it would be best to turn back.
